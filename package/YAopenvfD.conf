# Please set the following configurations up according to one of the following source:
# - Arthur Libreman's official OpenVFD configurations, a lot of configs available, but some older ones might have wrong gpio
#   https://github.com/arthur-liberman/vfd-configurations
# - Ophub's Armbian repo, only a few configs, but some of them might have different yet correct gpio, some LED dots info are also correct
#   https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/tree/main/build-armbian/armbian-files/platform-files/amlogic/rootfs/usr/share/openvfd/conf

# This is the OpenVFD module config for HK1 Box (S905X3), but it would probably not work on your box
